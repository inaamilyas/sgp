# Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System Pseudocode

# Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation
Load user-item interaction data
Preprocess and clean the data (e.g., handle missing values, normalize ratings)

# Step 2: User-Item Matrix
Create a user-item matrix where rows represent users and columns represent items
Populate the matrix with user-item interaction data (e.g., user ratings)

# Step 3: Similarity Calculation
Compute a similarity metric between users or items (e.g., cosine similarity, Pearson correlation)
Create a similarity matrix based on the computed similarities

# Step 4: Recommendation Generation
For a target user:
   Identify similar users (or items) based on the similarity matrix
   Select a subset of the most similar users (or items) as neighbors

   For each item not interacted by the target user:
      Predict the user's rating for the item (e.g., weighted average of neighbors' ratings)
      Rank the items by predicted ratings

   Return the top N recommended items for the target user

# Step 5: Evaluation (Optional)
Split the data into training and testing sets for evaluation
Evaluate the recommendation system's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or precision-recall

# Step 6: Deployment (Optional)
Deploy the recommendation system in a production environment
Continuously update the system with new user-item interactions and recompute recommendations
