how to reload django server automatically
why python code not use updated pickle files

I am making a django project. I create a custom class in customclass.py
import mysql.connector
class MyClass:
    data = []
    
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
                host="127.0.0.1",
                user="root",
                password="",
                database="study_guideline_portal",
            )
    mycursor = mydb.cursor()
    def __init__(self):
        # Fetching lessons from database and creating dataframe
        self.mycursor.execute('SELECT * FROM studyguidelineportal_data;')
        data = self.mycursor.fetchall()
        print(data)
then in a view in views.py i create an object 
classobj = MyClass()

then i made changes to the database using django admin panel but it shows old data
